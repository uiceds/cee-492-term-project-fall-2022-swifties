## Exploratory Data Analysis {.page_break_before}

Open-source crash data is published by the Illinois Department of Transportation (IDOT) yearly. Each crash report was found to have extensive entries with up to 85 attributes, which include several independent variables to describe each occurence. Each dataset is organized with observations filled out according to the IDOT Traffic Crash Report SR 1050 Instruction Manual (2019). The datasets for each year are available online in .CSV format at the IDOT website, and they contain observations arranged in rows and attributes in columns. The datasets from 2017, 2018, and 2019 were included in this Exploratory Data Analysis. The datasets from 2020 and 2021 were discarded in this analysis given the COVID-19 pandemic outbreak, which altered drastically the dynamics of traffic worldwide, and thus crash-related data (Yasin, Grivna & Abu-Zidan, 2021). Regarding the dataset size, each one had originally over 300,000 rows (944,328 in total, combined).
The Exploratory Data Analysis will be carried out following the steps described in the next sections.

### Reading the Data

The datasets were imported to Visual Studio Code using the CSV library. It was found that the latest report contained 5 additional attributes that could not be used since they were missing in previous reports. It was verified that any other attribute was arranged in the same way for each file, thus it was decided to discard this information. After deleting these attributes, all 03 datasets were merged into a unified file, which contains 80 variables (columns) and 944,328 observations (rows). This final database serves as the baseline to start the cleaning process.

### Cleaning Process

It was found that several independent variables would not provide fruitful information due to missing, unknown or incomplete data. First, this observation was obtained by visual inspection, and later by analyzing the number of different and unique values present in each attribute. Thus, the datasets were processed to filter out irrelevant or incomplete variables. For instance, information pertaining the location (latitude & longitude, or X & Y coordinates) have not been taken into account. A map plot was initially produced to see the distribution of the data though. Columns containing codes describing the city, county or ID of the location where the crash took place have also been excluded. Columns involving duplicate information (e.g. two columns describing the same independent variable with a label and a number), and traffic structures were also removed. For few other independent variables, information that could potentially be useful was found to be significantly incomplete. For instance, this was the case of attributes such as the number of lanes and the type of intersection. As a consequence, these variables were not included on the clean dataset. Finally, additional cleaning was carried out for independent variables with a high number of description labels. For example, the "Railroad Crossing Number" variable had up to 100 different values which would have not been handy information for the end-user. After filtering out all the attributes that would not be utilized for this analysis, the number of independent variables went down from 80 to 21.

When it comes to crash reports, several inconsistencies are considerably frequent. In the literature, for example, it is mentioned that "investigation of traffic safety by means of crash records is a reactive approach, where researchers need to deal with imprecise, incomplete, inconsistent, and, sometimes, inexistent records", and thats why the acquisition of historical series to provide minimal consistency to the analysis of crashes to reduce misinterpretations and misleading conclusions is crucial (Hauer & Hakkert, 1989; Chin & Quek, 1997; Farmer, 2003). This justifies the need of dedicating a considerable amount of time, after filtering the columns (variables) of interest, to the cleaning process of the rows (observations). For each column, the observations labeled as "blank", "unknown", and "other" were matter of discussion among the group on how these inconsistencies would be handled. For all variables, the "blank" observations were immediately removed from the dataset.

Trends

#### Potential Issues
Once the data was analyzed from the visualization efforts, it could be observed that most of the crashes are reported in conditions that were initially hypothesized to represent a “safer” scenario. A high percentage of the crashes reported after data cleaning was reported in the following conditions: (i) daylight, (ii) dry surface, (iii) no road defects, (iv) no work-zone. This way, this should be considered for the future modeling.
