## Exploratory Data Analysis {.page_break_before}

Open-source crashes' data is publicided by the Illinois Department of Transportation (IDOT), yearly. Each year's dataset was found to have extensive crashes' reports, which include several variables to describe each crash event. Each dataset is organized with observations filled according to the IDOT Traffic Crash Report SR 1050 Instruction Manual (2019). The datasets for each year are available in .csv format by IDOT, and they contain the observations arranged in rows and the independent variables in columns. The datasets from 2017, 2018, and 2019 were included in this Exploratory Data Analysis. The datasets from 2020 and 2021 were discarded in this analysis given the COVID-19 pandemic outbreak, which altered drastically the dynamics of traffic worldwide, and of course crash-related data (Yasin, Grivna & Abu-Zidan, 2021). When it comes to the size of the datasets, each one had over 300,000 rows (944,328 in total, combined), and at least 80 columns (only the 2019 dataset included 5 extra columns, discarded).

### Reading the Data

To carry out the first step, the datasets were imported to Visual Studio Code using the CSV library. The datasets were merged into a unified file once the total numbers of columns of each of them were matched to an homegeneus number since it was noticeable that the latest dataset included additional independent variables the first two did not include. The three files were merged into a new database after this first sanity check. The final dataset integrated 80 variables (columns) and 944,328 observations (rows).

### Cleaning Process

It was found that several independent variables would not provide fruitful information due to missing, unknown or incomplete data. Thus, the datasets were visually inspected to filter out irrelevant or incomplete variables. For instance, information pertaining the location (latitude & longitude, or X & Y coordinates) have not been taken into account. Columns containing codes describing the city, county or ID of the location where the crash took place has also been excluded. Columns involving duplicate information (e.g. two columns describing the same independent variable with a label and a number), traffic structures, etc were also removed. For some other independent variables, information that would have been useful was found to be significantly incomplete such as the number of lanes or type of intersection and therefore it was decided to not include it. Additionaly, independent variables with a high number of labels to describe them such as Railroad Crossing Number were also filtered out since it would not provide handy information for the end-user.

After filtering out the information that will not be utilized for this analysis, the number of independent variables went from 80 to 21.


### Project Objective and Plan Proposal

The objective of this work is to use the Illinois Department of Transportation (IDOT) extensive crash data to be analyzed and, finally, be used for a crash risk prediction model based on main categorical data that can be real-time updated (such as the weather/lighting/pavement conditions). Ideally, it could be used by navigation systems to allert drivers to adopt more cautious behavior as soon as they enter higher-risk sections. 

The plan to be carried out will follow the basic steps described as follows:

1. Read the IDOT's crash data CSV files available as an open data source.
2. Clean the data by deleting unwanted columns, handling missing data, and removing irrelevant observations.
3. Tidy the data by organizing the variables into columns and the observations into rows.
4. Analyze and visualize the data by finding correlations both analytically and graphically.
5. Model a prediction algorithm for crash risk according to categorical variables.
