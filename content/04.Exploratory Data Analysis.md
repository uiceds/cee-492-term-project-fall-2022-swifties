## Exploratory Data Analysis {.page_break_before}

Open-source crash data is published by the Illinois Department of Transportation (IDOT) yearly. Each crash report was found to have extensive entries with up to 85 attributes, which include several independent variables to describe each crash occurence. Each dataset is organized with observations filled out according to the IDOT Traffic Crash Report SR 1050 Instruction Manual (2019). The dataset for each year is available online in .CSV format at the IDOT website, and they contain observations arranged in rows and attributes in columns. The datasets from 2017, 2018, and 2019 were included in this Exploratory Data Analysis. The datasets from 2020 and 2021 were discarded in this analysis due to the COVID-19 pandemic outbreak, which altered drastically the dynamics of traffic worldwide, and thus crash-related data (Yasin, Grivna & Abu-Zidan, 2021). Regarding the dataset size, each one had originally over 300,000 rows (944,328 in total, combined).
The Exploratory Data Analysis will be carried out following the steps described in the next sections.

### Reading the Data

The datasets were imported to Visual Studio Code using the CSV library. It was found that the latest report contained 5 additional attributes that could not be used since they were missing in previous reports. It was verified that any other attribute was arranged in the same way for each file, thus it was decided to discard this additional information. After deleting these attributes, all 03 datasets were merged into a unified file, which contains 80 variables (columns) and 944,328 observations (rows). This final database served as the baseline to start the cleaning process.

### Cleaning Process

It was found that several independent variables would not provide fruitful information due to missing, unknown or incomplete data. First, this observation was obtained by visual inspection, and later by analyzing the number of different and unique values present in each attribute. Thus, the datasets were processed to filter out irrelevant or incomplete variables. For instance, information pertaining the location (latitude & longitude, or X & Y coordinates) has not been taken into account. A map plot was initially produced to see the distribution of the data. Columns containing codes describing the city, county or ID of the location where the crash took place have also been excluded. Columns involving duplicate information (e.g. two columns describing the same independent variable with a label and a number), and traffic structures were also removed. For few other independent variables, information that could potentially be useful was found to be significantly incomplete. For instance, this was the case of attributes such as the number of lanes and the type of intersection. As a consequence, these variables were not included in the clean dataset. Finally, additional cleaning was carried out for independent variables with a high number of description labels. For example, the "Railroad Crossing Number" variable had up to 100 different values which would have not been handy information for the end-user. After filtering out all the attributes that would not be utilized for this analysis, the number of independent variables went down from 80 to 21.

When it comes to crash reports, several inconsistencies are considerably frequent. In the literature, for example, it is mentioned that "investigation of traffic safety by means of crash records is a reactive approach, where researchers need to deal with imprecise, incomplete, inconsistent, and, sometimes, inexistent records", and that is why the acquisition of historical series to provide minimal consistency to the analysis of crashes to reduce misinterpretations and misleading conclusions is crucial (Hauer & Hakkert, 1989; Chin & Quek, 1997; Farmer, 2003). This justifies the need of dedicating a considerable amount of time, after filtering the columns (variables) of interest, to the cleaning process of the rows (observations). For each column, the observations labeled as "blank", "unknown", and "other" were a matter of discussion among the group on how these inconsistencies would be handled. For all variables, the "blank" observations were immediately removed from the dataset. 


### Analysis and Visualization

In this section, a set of plots, charts, and visuals were developed using a set of tools: Julia, Python, and Power BI, and are presented to display the findings and trends, product of the exploratory data analysis. The visualization include distributions of car crashes over time and for the identified variables discussed in this report.

The first plot presented is a visual representation of the number of car crashes throughout time. This served as a foundational step for the later-developed visuals. Below, the data is subdivided by year, and then by month to better understand the number of car crashes through time.

For 2017, the month with the most incidents is December (“12”), with 28032 car crashes (out of 295651 for that year), and the month with the least car crashes is February (“2”), with 20049 incidents that month. These findings can represent the effect of weather conditions as well, given that during the very first and the later years of the year, the amount of accidents increases. These months correspond to the winter season and englobes certain holidays where people might be very active and potentially more car crashes might happen.

Now, for 2018, different from the previous year, the month with the largest count of accidents is November (“11”), with 28743 recorded crashes (out of 304196). The month with the least amount of crashes is March (“3”), with 22200 crashes. For this year, just like for 2017, the months where peaks happen can be associated with the worse seasons for a driver.

For the year 2019, the month with the most accidents is November (“11”), with 26964 recorded crashes (out of 283946), and the month with the least accidents is March (“3”), with 20569 incidents. in a similar way to the years 2017 and 2018, the months with the highest count happen in the same season.

Using the “X” and “Y” information present in the dataset, a visual distribution of the location of the recorded car crashes is illustrated in the map Figure. In the map of Illinois, the red dots represent a pair of “X” and “Y” coordinates, being the location where a car crash happened. The majority of car crashes appear to have happened in cities and towns. The best example would be Chicago, where all around the area, the number of occurrences, or red dots, is significantly higher, which may be presumable given that Chicago and the surrounding areas host a big fraction of the state’s population. On a smaller scale, this is also visible in other cities and towns, such as Springfield and Davenport. In other locations, the recorded car crashes are much more spaced out, with certain “hotspots” in some highways and roads. 


#### Pie Chart | Lightning Conditions

This figure displays the different percentages of the different lighting conditions presented in the dataset. The condition with the most car crashes associated with it is “Daylight”, representing 66% of the crashes in the dataset. During the nighttime, “Darkness/Lighted Road” accounts for 18% of the crashes, and “Darkness”, for 11%. Conditions “Dawn” and “Dusk” account for 2% each of the car crashes recorded.


#### Pie Chart |Road Surface Condition

The chart above summarizes the analysis performed on the data on the influence of road surface conditions on the number of car crashes. It was found that 76% of the recorded crashes correspond to a “dry” road surface, which can be thought of as the least dangerous condition. For the not-too-favorable road surface conditions, 16% of the car crashes analyzed correspond to a “wet” road surface, 5% to “snow”, 2% to “ice” and other “unknown” road surface conditions.


#### Pie Chart | Road Defects

While analyzing the distribution of accidents by road defects, it was found that the vast majority of the incidents (808,835 out of 883,793 observations, which accounts for 91.52%) happened were “no defects” were present in the location. Given that a great number of crashes happened without any road defects, it might be interesting to account for the likelihood of road defects being associated with a car crash. Figure 6 displays the different percentages of the road defects accounted for in the dataset, where “unknown” represents 78% of the data, followed by 6% for “worn surfaces”, “debris on the roadway” and “other” road defects, and 2% for “ruts and holes” and “shoulder” defects. 



#### Correlation between Variables

As mentioned earlier, one of the objectives of analyzing this data is understanding how different road and environment conditions would affect crashes and their severity. This can be obtained by finding the associations between the different variables (columns) in the dataset, meaning how one variable is affected another variable.
However, most of the variables are of categorical type, i.e., variables that are identified based on names or labels given to them and not based on numbers. This makes the built-in correlation functions in Python or Julia not helpful. One very commonly used method to measure the correlation between two categorical variables is Cramer’s V statistic. Cramer’s V is based on a nominal variation of Pearson’s Chi-Square Test. Like correlation, the output takes values between 0 and 1 (inclusive), with 0 corresponding to no association between the variables and 1 corresponding to one variable being completely determined by the other. On the other hand, and unlike the usual correlation, there are no negative values.
For this project, a function was created in Python that calculates the association between any 2 categorical columns using confusion matrix which can be obtained via built-in pandas method for categorical columns.
For this data that has 24 columns, running this function for every pair of variables would take a long time and may not give many insights. Therefore, the function was used to find how the column “CrashSeverity” is correlated with every other column. This column was chosen because finding how different conditions affect the severity of the crash is one of the most important outcomes of studying this dataset, and this would give an idea about the variables that have a significant impact on the crashes.

The output is described in the table below:

|                               | Association with CrashSeverity         
|:------------------------------|:-------------:|
| CrashYr                       | 0.008         |

| CollisionTypeCode             | 0.259         | 
| TotalFatals                   | 0.707         | 
| TotalInjured                  | 0.706         | 
| NoInjuries                    | 0.356         | 
| CrashSeverity                 | 1             | 
| IntersectionRelated           | 0.141         |
| RoadwayFunctionalClassCode    | 0.071         | 
| WorkZoneRelated               | 0.005         | 
| TypeOfFirstCrash              | 0.259         | 
| CityName                      | 0.074         | 
| ClassOfTrafficWay             | 0.061         | 
| Cause1                        | 0.166         | 
| TrafficControlDevice          | 0.098         |
| TrafficControlDeviceCond      | 0.052         | 
| RoadSurfaceCond               | 0.033         | 
| RoadDefects                   | 0.042         |
| LightingCond                  | 0.028         | 
| WeatherCond                   | 0.031         | 

From the table above, it can be observed that the the factor that is the most correlated to the crash severity is the "TotalFatals" column which indicates the number of fatalities for each crash, with a  value of 0.707. Similar observations can be made for the number of injuries. This makes sense because it is expected that the higher the severity of the crash, the higher the number of fatalities and injuries is expected to be. However, this is not very helpful for understanding how different conditions affect the severity of the crash. For this purpose, the columns that can be compared are: "IntersectionRelated", "RoadwayFunctionClassCode", "WorkZoneRelated", "ClassOfTrafficWay", "TrafficControlDevice", "TrafficControlDeviceCond", "RoadSurfaceCond", "RoadDefects", "LightingCond" and "WeatherCond".
Comapring these, it can be seen that presence of intersections has the highest correlation with the severity of the crash followed by the traffic control device. In addition, the characteristics of the workzone seem to have the least correlation with the severity of the crash.
This observation can be useful to understand the dataset and get an idea about which variables are important for making predictions. This was done to get a general idea about the data but for performing predictions, this will be handled in detail.

### Trends

Since not all the variables have to be present for an accident to occur, it can be seen that most accidents happen in the absence of adverse conditions. However, we should take into account that this reflects the fact that adverse conditions are exceptions, and accidents happen on a daily basis with other factors as underlying reasons such as human behavior. However, adverse conditions do increase the likelihood of accidents and it can be observed an increase in the overall number of occurrences in specific hours (evening), days (weekends), and months (winter).The road type is also found to be directly correlated with the maximum speed limit, and as a consequence is tied to the number of accidents per day.


### Potential Issues

As long as the number of entries containing a value for an independent variable overcome by large any other value for the same independent variable, we may experience problems related to "imbalanced data" due to the uneven distribution of observations.
Similarly, it can be seen that most of the independent variables are "classifications", and therefore their entries don't provide meaningul numerical values to be analyzed or correlated. For some of them we could replace the text values by boolean variables, but for some others a rating system may be needed if a numerical interpretation is required. 

It can be noticed that most of the attributes are subjective observations trying to describe the potential causes of an accident, and may be dependent on the observer itself. However, the casualties are a meaningful numerical observation that will be thoroughly used througout this report.
