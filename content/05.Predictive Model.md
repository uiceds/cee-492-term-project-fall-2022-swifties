## Predictive Model {.page_break_before}

Open-source crash data is published by the Illinois Department of Transportation (IDOT) yearly. Each crash report was found to have extensive entries with up to 85 attributes, which include several independent variables to describe each occurence. Each dataset is organized with observations filled out according to the IDOT Traffic Crash Report SR 1050 Instruction Manual (2019). The datasets for each year are available online in .CSV format at the IDOT website, and they contain observations arranged in rows and attributes in columns. The datasets from 2017, 2018, and 2019 were included in this Exploratory Data Analysis. The datasets from 2020 and 2021 were discarded in this analysis given the COVID-19 pandemic outbreak, which altered drastically the dynamics of traffic worldwide, and thus crash-related data (Yasin, Grivna & Abu-Zidan, 2021). Regarding the dataset size, each one had originally over 300,000 rows (944,328 in total, combined).
The Exploratory Data Analysis will be carried out following the steps described in the next sections.
